# "That Simple Task Manager Web Application"
This is a todo list app made with the MERN(Mongo Express React Node) Stack. I did this app to learn how to combine all the individual technologies I learnt and create an app in MERN stack. This project is an application specially built to keep track of tasks that need to be done. this application will be like a task keeper where the user would be able to enter the tasks that they need to do. Once they are done with their tasks they can also remove them from the list.

## What did I learn?
How to use express.js, node.js and React to build a simple application How to connect MongoDB to an application using mongoose How to use the npm package manager.

## Biggest challenge:
Deployment to Herolify and control flow with github. Trying to understand how all the files bootstrapped with create-react-app. Getting the MongoDB server up and running on my machine. Did I mention deployment?

## Future ideas:
- Extend app into a study planner with customisable options such as due date, subject, study category etc.

- Add calendar so users can assign todos to certain days

- Add pomodoro timer

- User can create sub-tasks and dependencies, projects, and sub-projects.

- Attach due dates to these tasks, prioritize them using a color-coding system, categorize them, and more.
